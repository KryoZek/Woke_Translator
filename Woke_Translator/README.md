/*      This small project will take a file input from the terminal
        it'll read the text and replace any 'a' and 'o' with 'x' .
        To provide an immersive modern-day academic experience
        for the writer without having to worry they made a mistake. */

This is a small project for a student getting started in programming.
I started this so I could review file reading, managing vectors and classes.

Just For Fun~
